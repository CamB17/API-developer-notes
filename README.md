# External API Developer Notes

Here at GA we have compiled notes from our developer students about the APIs they have used.  Hopefully these notes will help guide you in your work with external APIs.

## General

This is where general API notes/advice will go.

## Spotify

And this is where specific API notes will go.

Try to include links and pictures wherever possible.


## PetFinder

Easy to use API that returns data in JSON or XML depending on preference. The documentation provides you with ample descriptions of how to receive the type of data you want to and lets you hone in on specifics like age, location, breed, type of animal, etc. The data comes back with all the information you could possibly want to know about each animal along with image links, contact information and detailed descriptions.

The documentation provides you with examples of the routes you'll need to use to get back the information you want.

APIs don't need to be ruff.
