# External API Developer Notes

Here at GA we have compiled notes from our developer students about the APIs they have used.  Hopefully these notes will help guide you in your work with external APIs.

## General

This is where general API notes/advice will go.

## Mashape

https://www.mashape.com/

This API library has a lot of great api's to choose from along with great documentation. The only problem is that Mashape uses the unirest library for the requests, which we haven't covered yet. Besides the unirest issue, Mashape is a great place to find an api. 

Mashape's documentation comes along with examples for each request which is nice. Also Mashape provides the endpoints to test in PostMan which is very helpful. 

## GOOGLE MAPS API

by alex:
highly recommend this api, great instructions online and lots of room for expansion and personalization. just takes a second to get used to their 'specific' commands, in this sense reading the documentation is essential otherwise you might be banging your head against the wall like "WHY CAN'T I GET THE LATITUDE WHEN I'M SAYIN .LAT", because it's not quite as simple as that. Like I said, highly recommend. 10/10 would use again.
