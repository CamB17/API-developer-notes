# External API Developer Notes

Here at GA we have compiled notes from our developer students about the APIs they have used.  Hopefully these notes will help guide you in your work with external APIs.

## ShopStyle API

ShopStyle is a great API for anyone that wants to access multiple retailers & clothing items all from one source.  Some examples are Nordstrom, Shopbop, etc.  The API returns JSON and is pretty straightforward but has a LOT of information to sort through so it's a great idea to think through your specific goals before diving in.  Getting the key is pretty easy, all you have to do is create an account through ShopStyle and they generate an API key that you can access through your account settings.  Here is a link to the API overview with directions:

And this is where specific API notes will go.

Try to include links and pictures wherever possible.
