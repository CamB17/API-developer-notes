# External API Developer Notes

Here at GA we have compiled notes from our developer students about the APIs they have used.  Hopefully these notes will help guide you in your work with external APIs.

## General

This is where general API notes/advice will go.

## Spotify

And this is where specific API notes will go.

Try to include links and pictures wherever possible.

## Co Trails

For this app I used the api "TrailAPI" from the site Mashape. While this api includes alot about trails around the world, it needs the npm library 'unirest' to function. There is documentation on unirest through npmjs.com, however its very exensive and time consuming to learn how to use it in 5 days. I also searched for tutorials on using unirest while buildiung restful routes and found one guy who was using Angular. Try not to use unirest.
